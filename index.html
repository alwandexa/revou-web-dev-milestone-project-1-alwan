          <h3>Javascript</h3>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a text-based computer programming language used to
            make dynamic web pages. A must-learn for aspiring web developers or
            programmers, JavaScript can be used for features like image
            carousels, displaying countdowns and timers, and playing media on a
            webpage. With JavaScript online classes, you can learn to build
            interactive web applications, choose the best framework, and work
            with other programming languages like HTML and CSS.
